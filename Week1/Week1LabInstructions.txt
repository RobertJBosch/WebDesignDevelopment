Preparation

Install Visual Studio Code and the VSCode LiveServer extension if you haven't already done so.  Links for these installations are under Software Installation.

For this lab, put all of the files you create below in the "Week 1" folder.  No need to create a separate folder for each exercise as was stated in Lab Submissions.

VSCode

Open the folder where you want to save your lab work.

LiveServer
The first time you use LiveServer you'll need to start it.  In VSCode, select "Command Palette" from the "View" menu.  At the prompt, type "Live Server" until you see "LiveServer: Open with LiveServer".  Select that and LiveServer should then start with opening a browser.  LiveServer will then display "Port: 5500" at the bottom of VSCode.  To close LiveServer, click on "Port: 5000".  LiveServer will then display "Go Live".  Click on "Go Live" when you want LiveServer to startup again with the HTML page you are working on.  As you work through the exercises you can click on "Go Live" at the bottom of VSCode to start a browser and view the pages you are creating as you make changes.

If you are not familiar with HTML then start with the HTML Introduction (Links to an external site.) on W3Schools.
